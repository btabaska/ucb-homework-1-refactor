# Homework 1 HTML 5 Semantic Tag Refactor

In this homework, I have refactored this web page to meet the semantic tag requirements of HTML 5 to improve SEO and code readability and also consolidated the CSS to remove extraneous classes, duplicated code and reorganized some of the CSS to make the file more readable.
